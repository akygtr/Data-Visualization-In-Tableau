This Tableau project explores two interlinked themes within this rapidly evolving landscape: the influence of AI milestones on stock performance and the contributions of tech hubs to North America's GDP growth. By analyzing extensive datasets from credible sources such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and Quandl, this research provides a dual perspective on micro-level impacts on stock markets and macro-level contributions to economic growth. Using data aggregated through Python scripts and public APIs, I have joined the data sets using key fields such as Ticker and Country. This logical and physical data integration forms the foundation of my analysis.
Additionally, the project incorporates advanced tools and techniques such as Tableau for visualization and Python for data preprocessing, making it not just a study in analysis but also a hands-on application of technical skills. The integration of AI milestones adds another layer of complexity, as it requires identifying key events and mapping them to market and economic data.
